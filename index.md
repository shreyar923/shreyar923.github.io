Lab 7:
- I really liked lab 7 because I thought the card game idea was fun to figure out and I enjoyed learning about Blackjacks as well while doing the coding. I thought coding the sequences was also interesting. I also just had a fun experience writing the functions to coordinate with the game. 

Lab 8:
- My favorite lab of all was Lab 8. I really loved the madlib concept because I thought it was fun filling in the blanks with the different words. I also think that it was challenging, but nice to figure out and is better and more simplified once you get the hang of it. I enjoyed the overall coding in it because it wasnâ€™t too complicated. 

Lab 12:
- I also enjoyed Lab 12 because we put into action the things we had learned about in the readings like with the random number generator. I thought it was a bit confusing, but it made it interesting. I liked the incorporation it had from previous labs as well like from Lab 10.
